#Fourier Studies
###by royMacdonald


I've posted in this repo the apps I've done in order to better understand the [Discrete Fourier Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform).
You can find a thorough writting about these [here.](http://roymacdonald.github.io/random/2015/06/01/FourierStudies.html)

These use the creative coding toolkit [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc).
In order to use these you'll need to download the newest version of openFrameworks from [github](https://github.com/openframeworks/openframeworks).

if you have Git installed on your machine just copy/paste the following into Terminal.

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks.git
```

then clone this repo

```
cd openFrameworks/apps/
git clone https://github.com/roymacdonald/FourierStudies.git
```

once done just run the projects for each app.
